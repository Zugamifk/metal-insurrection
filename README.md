An open world sci-fi FPS

# Backstory
The technology of replacing organic body parts with cybernetic parts has become advanced and accessible to nearly everyone. The popular trend is to replace body parts with modular components that can be swapped for different purposes. Along with it, a black market for components containing deadly weapons, hacking tools, and other illicit functions has come along. This has lead to widespread underground activity, terrorism and most recently, a large scale rebellion.

This rebellion contained individuals with a large number of modifications, many of whom had some vital organs replaced. These people are unable to live without their cybernetic parts. The government took advantage of this weakness, first by declaring cybernetic parts illegal, then arresting all individuals who still had them and confiscating their parts. Many people died without their vital parts, and their bodies along with all decomissioned cybernetic components were disposed in a mass grave underneath the city.

Since quashing the rebellion, a culture of paranoia has arisen around human augmentation and robotics. A cult of purists, who reject all technology and electronics is gaining popularity. Since decomissioning all cybernetic parts, the government has moved to restricting access to robots and androids which are also capable of using these components. There is widespread propaganda poromoting the idea of disposing of all autonomous and advanced electronics.

## Part 1 - Escape
You begin as a highly modified human who wakes up in the mass grave under the city. After having most of your components removed, officials assumed you were dead and disposed of you there. You have gone through massive physical and mental trauma, having lost all memories and most of your physical funcionality. However, you are not the only one to wake up. Something has caused hundreds of others to awaken at the same time, and are now desperately seeking necessary parts to return to full functionality. You must fight to survive and escape the undercity.

## Part 2 - Safety
Having escaped the undercity, you must now navigate the city above ground while hiding your cybernatic nature. You have multiple objectives here:
1) Find a safe house to sleep in and use as storage
2) Find allies
3) Find out what caused you and hundreds of others to suddenly reawaken from decomission, and find out why they did it
4) Find a doctor who can give you a more permanent way to stay disguised, or replace components with organic parts

During this time you will learn the layout of the city, and run into many different storylines about the past, present and future
You will eventually learn that even if you become fully organic, you will never be treated the same again. There are those who will always doubt your past and question your true motives.
You will discover the black market for cybernetic components stil exists, although much smaller and much more secretive.
You will learn about a group of hunters who seek out any remaining cybernetically augmented humans to arrest or kill. There are many bounties out.
As others escape the undercity behind you, news will get out about a sudden threat of an "undead" army infiltrating the city, possibly to begin a second rebellion. 
You will learn that whoever caused this sudden reawakening is working from within the government.

## Part 3 - Purpose
By now, the city has grown very aware of the mass reawakening of augmented humans, as hundreds or thousands have managed to escape the undercity. The government has begun attempting to seal all entrances and exits to the undercity as well as sent in many missions to destroy any of the reawakened they find.

The cult of organic purists has become much stronger and more influential. The hunters have also grown much bigger as more and more people join them out of fear. Together, the two groups have created a massive network of surveillance, not only to find augmented humans, but anyone else who shows signs of sympathy towards them. 

All androids and robots are now being systematically destroyed and decommissioned, and the parts being melted down to ensure they can never be reused or repurposed.
You learn that there are several secret refuges for augmented humans, many of which have been discovered and raided.
You learn more about the individuals responsible for this reawakening. You meet contacts who can get you in touch with them. You learn that you will not be able to do this alone.
Your objectives now are:
1) Find names and positions of those in the government responsible for the awakening
2) Assemble a trusted group of individuals who can get you into the government facility
3) While remaining undetected, find those individuals, demand answers, and establish a means of contact with them.
4) Escape undetected

You will learn that there is a secret group inside the government that wishes for the return of cybernetic augmentation. They believe the only means of doing this is through a coup or rebellion. They believe the only individuals they can count on to fight for them are augmented humans.
You learn this group is divided on the issue of the black markets, one side believing it can coexist in the world of augmented humans, the other believing it must be suppressed.
You learn that they do not believe in a peaceful uprising, and that the government will only respond to any signs of augmentation supporters with violence.

## Part 4 - Organization
A large rally is organized by the government leaders to gain the morale of the people against the newly reawakened augmented humans. Propanganda is increased and anyone 'vetted' as truly organic will gain benefits from the government. If you have managed to find a good enough disguise, or managed to become fully organic, you are elligible for these benefits.

You have three paths open to you from here.

### Align with the coup
You are given direct routes of contact with a few of the members of those in the government planning the coup. There are many more, but they are kept secret from you. Because of this, you are given a secret question/answer to identify each other. One of the members you are in contact with is connected to the black markets and can get you into contact with them if you haven't found a way already. Another member you are in contact with will give you information on anyone else in the government, for a price. Another, the leader of the coup, will try to contact regularly and ask you to do work for them to prove yor loyalty. Failure will result in them treating you like an enemy.

Eventually, they will give you the task of finding all of the refuges you can, and spreading the words of the intended coup. You will be the main point of contact. You must find a way to stay hidden and safe while also remaining accessible to both the government rebels and the refuges that need direction. You will be the main way that the government rebels pass information and aid to the refuges, and that the refuges pass information and their status to the government coup.

The main plan will be to infiltrate the rally and assassinate as many government officials as possible using black market and government supplies. Information is key. Access to surveillance data is key. Crippling security is key. If possible, it should not seem like cybernetically enhanced humans were involved in the killings. It should appear like a message that the people to not support this rally.

### Align with the government
You bring the information of the coup to leaders of the government. If you are well disguised, you will have to come up with a lie for how you came upon this information. If not, you will have to convince them you are on their side.

Regardless, they will ask you to act as a mole and play along with the coup. You will learn about the same plan as outlined above, except you will not get in contact with the refuges, you will not put yourself in a position as the main point of contact, instead letting one of your allies you helped you on your mission to contact the government rebels become the new leader. You may or may not choose to tell your allies about your true allegiance.

If you tell them, your chosen leader will confront you and eventually leave, becoming your enemy and notifying all other augmented humans of your betrayal. You are now a pariah and will have to rely on the government for safety, although regular authorities will persecute you if given the chance, as they will never admit to being allied to an augmented human.

Eventually you will learn from your remaining allies that the plan to infiltrate the event is being planned. You will need to gain as much information on the plan as possible and, knowing that sabotauge is planned, you will have to act as the back up security. You will need to gain as much information as possible on who is going to carry out the killings and how, and you will need to prevent them. 

If you can, you should try to bring some refuges to your side. No reward or redemption is promised. You will only argue out of principle.

### Organize your own revolt
You decide the government can not be trusted, no matter the promises. You maintain the contacts with the government rebels, but only to gain as much information from them as possible. Without the guidance of officials from the government, eventually your lack of loyalty is suspected and you are cut off from the rebel movement.
